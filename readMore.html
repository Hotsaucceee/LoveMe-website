            <p id="first-paragraph">Not all relationships survive the test of time and there will always be moments when you would feel the need to finally give up and let go. However, it's not also that easy to just drop everything and leave because you're talking about something that once made you the happiest person in the world - so you are stuck in the frustrating and often heartbreaking dilemma between staying and saying goodbye.</p>

            <p>If you're ever trapped in this scenario, perhaps two of the questions you have tried but never dared to ask are, is there still hope to bring back what was lost? Does your relationship still deserve a second chance? If both of your answers is positive and faithful YES, then let us help you figure out the first step of the many steps that you should be taking.</p>

            <p>Here are the ways to revive a dying relationship and finally be happy again.</p>

            <h3>1. Take a break but don't say goodbye.</h3>
            <p>Don't give up on your relationship yet because as long as you both believe in your love for each other, there will always be a rainbow after every storm. Maybe you just need a break from everything? Take all the time that you need - both of you. Trying to fix an almost <strong>broken relationship</strong> can be emotionally taxing and sometimes it can even affect you physically so take it easy. You deserve to breathe - and remember that at the end of this remedy, you have someone to come home to.</p>

            <h3>2. Talk about it and be honest with each other.</h3>
            <p>What went wrong? Whatever happened to your promises of love and expressions of affection? Talk to each other. Communicate and be honest and truthful about how you really feel. Tell them about the time when they hurt you but you're too scared to show it.</p>
            <p>Just go on and ask the questions that have been bothering you all this time. What triggered this endless and current downfall? Admit your mistakes and have faith in the fact that it's not yet too late to fix it.</p>

            <h3>3. Remember why you love them.</h3>
            <p>You were once the happiest person in the world because you've finally met your soulmate - the love of your life. Remember those important moments of elation. Even if your heart is filled with hurt and has suffered so much pain, they're still there, just waiting to be found.</p>

            <h3>4. Take the good parts and learn from the bad.</h3>
            <p>It's important that you learn the lessons from all these. Although both of you want to fix this and make the pain go away, it's not a wise thing to forget and just let go of the faults that contributed to this situation. Recognize that you both are responsible for what happened and try your best not to repeat the same mistakes again.</p>
            <p>More importantly, focus on the good parts. How did this stage help you to become a better person? How did it <strong>strengthen your relationship</strong> and love for each other?</p>

            <h3>5. Don't let anger do the talking.</h3>
            <p>Your relationship is fragile and even the tiniest hint of negativity can have the ability to break the already weak and delicate string that's keeping your relationship together. Anger, for instance, is one of the factors that can instantly and surely kill the chances of solving the problem. Try your best not to accommodate and entertain this negativity.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Stop hurting each other more.</h3>
            <p>Don't add more to the list of reasons why you should give up and end it all. Remember that you're in this delicate stage and one wrong move can ruin all your effort of trying to save your failing relationship. Be sensitive and careful not to hurt each other more.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Consider spending time apart.</h3>
            <p>When it's really that bad, you can try to consider this option of being physically away from each other. Sometimes distance can remind you of the things that you have taken for granted. Distance will also make you realize what it would feel like to live a life without them.</p>

            <h3>8. Seek advice from others who made it.</h3>
            <p>Listen to the stories of others who made it work. Of course, their situation can be different from yours but you can always gain something from the experiences of others.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Don't let other people make the decisions.</h3>
            <p>In connection to the previous section, you have to remember that it is you and only you who should make the final decision. You should remember that your own feelings and your own thoughts should be the basis of every choice that you make.</p>

            <h3>10. Be kind to each other.</h3>
            <p>Kindness can do a lot especially if you're trying to <strong>revive a dying relationship</strong>. Realize that both of you have been hurt and the best way to support each other is to just be kind and be gentle. Let kindness comfort your soul and slowly <strong>heal your broken hearts</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>11. Create better memories together.</h3>
            <p>Create new memories that will remind you of the better days. Travel together, go somewhere and just have fun. Leave everything that hurts and just live your life to the fullest. Do this together as if it's your last day on earth.</p>

            <h3>12. Show them how much you want this to last.</h3>
            <p>You have to show them how much this means to you. Be genuinely open about your feelings and sincerely express your love for them. Renew your vows and make new promises - and this time, do your best to keep them.</p>
            <p>Unlike the stories that you read about in fairytales, not everything follows a direct and sure path to a happy ever after. It won't be easy and sometimes you'll fail to do your part but hold on and have a little faith in love. Remind yourself that just like any painful and hurtful stage of life, this, too, shall pass - and both of you will be there to survive it all.</p>
            <p>Again, believe in the power of love and hold on to the promise of better days. Once you last this seemingly endless storm, you'll rise up together, stronger and nothing can ever break you apart again.</p>
